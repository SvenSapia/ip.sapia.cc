# ip.sapia.cc
## What's this?
A simple script to get your (external) ip-address.
## Why?
Comparable webservices are bloated up with ads and unnecessary javascript. You can use this script with cURL and get a readable output.
## ToDo
- GeoIP
- Name variables better
- Message if PTR is not resolvable
- Store URLs in vars
- Detect cURL users -> Hide HTML tags
