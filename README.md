# ip.sapia.cc
## What's this?
A simple script to get your (external) ip-address.
## Why?
Comparable webservices are bloated up with ads and unnecessary javascript. You can use this script with cURL and get a readable output.
## ToDo
- GeoIP and/or RIR lookup
- Store URLs in vars, so it's easier to setup
